    <h2>Rafflesia arnoldii</h2>
    <p>The Rafflesia arnoldii is the largest flower in the world and can be found in the rainforests of Sumatra. It is also called the corpse lily because of its unpleasant smell. Although humans do not enjoy it, the smell attracts insects that help pollinate the flower. Rafflesia flowers are hard to find, and the buds take months to develop.</p>
